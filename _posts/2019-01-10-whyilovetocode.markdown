I decided to learn software development so that I could build a career where I can use my creative and analytical skills everyday. Math was always my best subject and creativity makes me thrive. I love to learn and want to be challenged in my work. Iâ€™m committed to life-long learning, daily personal growth, and feeding my curiosity. I want to build and create new and unimaginable things. Software development also brings people together. I enjoy collaborating on projects to build my skills and offer my knowledge to others. I know in the ever evolving industry of technology I will always be learning, facing new challenges and pushing myself to grow.
