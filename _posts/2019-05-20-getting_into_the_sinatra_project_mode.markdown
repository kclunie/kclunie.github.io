I created an outfit app where users can sign up, log in and create outfit posts to share what they're wearing with their friends. Users can modify, delete and see all outfits created.

I thoroughly enjoyed building my Sinatra portfolio project. The CLI project provided great preparation for this project. The project really solidified how models, migrations, controllers and views work together. Creating an MVC app and incorporating the CRUD funtionality was a rewarding learning experience. Seeing my app come together and work was even better!
