For my Rails portfolio project I created an event app where users can sign up, log in, log out, create events, browse events, and attend events. Users can also indicate whether or not they will bring guests. 

I found this project to be challenging and insightful. One of the most challenging steps is just creating initial models and trying to figure out how everything will work together. Once that part is determined it's a bit easier to see how everything else will work out. Although, sometimes it's best to just start coding and try different things. I enjoyed building and testing the functionality of the app along the way to see what worked best.

I learned a lot by creating this project. It's not until practicing and putting everything together, that coding becomes more comprehensive. No matter how challenging, in the end it's always rewarding to see an app come to life.
