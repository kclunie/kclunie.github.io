For my Rails with a JavaScript front end app I built an event app where users can sign-up and log-in to create events and RSVP to attend events. Users can also add guests to their RSVP. Users are able to create any kind of event indicating date, time, location and details. 

I found this project to be challenging but with the right resources I made my way through my code and it became much more simple. I enjoyed implementing my JavaScript code on my new form page, testing my code, and watching my app transform every step of the way.

Adding JavaScript to my rails app gave me a new perspective on my app, solidfied my JavaScript knowledge and reinforced my coding skills overall.
