In these troubled times, many are feeling that hiring is at a hault. While COVID-19 is on the prawl and putting a dent in some industries, now is the time to ramp up our online presence. Individuals will be communicating, socializing, learning, shopping and working now more than ever on the web. Software engineers be prepared. In order to keep up with the job hunt, here are some tips:

1. Amp up your LinkedIn game - ensure your profile is attractive and a hot sell. Leave nothing out that could land you your next big gig.

2. Network network network - at least online - use LinkedIn to connect with other software enginners, recruiters or mutual connections. Keep the conversations going. What do you have to lose?

3. Keep applying - there are still jobs being posted so keep putting your resume out there. Someone will bite.

4. Practice your virual interview skills - record yourself giving your elevator pitch or answering common interview questions.

5. Friends and family - take the time to build better relationships with friends and family who could help you along your path.

6. Research - gather information on companies you are interested to join and people you want to contact. The more you know, the better you'll be prepared when that interview pops up.

7. Talk about it - get involved in chat groups to discuss the software engineering industry and popular news circulating. Getting the lingo down, prepares you to talk shop during the interview.

We're all in this together. We need to continue to build and reflect while we have this moment of silence. Many things will change, but the interweb ties that bring us together will only grow stronger.
