In exploring the creation of websites I have found that there are two different types of websites; **static** and **dynamic**. The word static can be defined as describing something lacking in movement, action, or change and dynamic refers to something characterized by constant change, activity, or progress. So there we have it, dynamic websites are active and static websites lazy, but what else?

A **static** website is usually built with HTML and CSS, and written in a text editor such a Visual Studio Code. No elements on the webpages are changed when accessing it. Static websites are basic pages that require simple code and design elements to create it. Static websites also have a fixed number of pages, meaning the website is designed with a certain number of pages and delivered exactly the same way. Of course, a user could always interact with a static website by clicking hyperlinks and filling in contact forms.

A static website can be described as informational and a dynamic website, functional. This brings us to **dynamic** websites, which allow users to interact with information on the webpage. Dynamic websites allow interactivity and functionality. Dynamic websites are also written in HTML and CSS, but server-side scripting is required to make them functional. HTML code designs the elements, while server-side languages, such as JavaScript, are used to execute webpage events and actions. When using a dynamic website, the site can be changed through code that is run in the browser and/or on the server. Dynamic content works using server-side and client-side scripting. Client-side scripting is code that is executed by the browser, usually with JavaScript. Server-side scripting refers to code that is executed by the server before the content is sent to the userâ€™s browser. So, a dynamic website will generate content and display it based on what actions the user makes on the webpage.

**And now, some rapid fire stats to draw the line:**

**Dynamic websites are:**

* great for building complex websites
* easier to maintain
* easy to expand with extra functionality
* manage data efficiently
* more complex
* take longer to build
* pricier
* easy to add eCommerce or social network functionality
* easy to add a variety of plugins
* at risk to potential security issues due to plugins

**Static websites are:**

* good for informational/buisness brochure websites
* simple to build
* cheaper to build
* non-interactive
* limited in functionality
* known to load faster
* not weighed down by underlying software/plugins to update
* easy to ensure your website is secure

So there we have it, both dynamic and static websites serve different purposes. While one may be active and complicated the other is lazy and simple. Whatever floats your boat.
